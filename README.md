# Dual-Axis-Solar-Tracking-System
This is an IoT project using Arduino and UNO R3 controller board to design a system that controls the turn angle of a solar panel so that it's always facing the sun directly at an angle that would maximize the voltage and energy captured.

details see: arduino -> instructions.md

Please see the physical demonstration of the system here: link[https://github.com/fjiang316/Dual-Axis-Solar-Tracking-System/blob/main/demostration/overview.md]
